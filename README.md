# Accommodation-System

Asia Pacific Home (APH) is working on a new project to make renting homes in the Klang 
Valley area of Malaysia easier and more efficient. By teaming up with APU tech-solution, 
they're creating a system that will take property listings from websites like Advert web (mudah) 
and organize them in one place. The new system will allow tenants to sort through over 10,000 
properties, save their favourite ones, and even request to rent them. Managers will be able to 
see tenant details, handle rent requests, and payments, while administrators can manage the 
user accounts. This project is all about using technology to make finding and renting a home 
as simple as possible.
